# flatui-radiocheck
jQuery radiocheck plugin lifted from https://github.com/designmodo/Flat-UI

# What is Flat-UI?
Flat UI is a free Bootstrap theme from the guys at designmodo. It consists of a set of CSS, some fonts, some image
assets and some JavaScripts (mostly jQuery plugins) to add some nice UI/UX behaviors.

# What is flatui-radiocheck?
This is just the jQuery radiocheck plugin. It will allow you to initialize custom radio- and checkboxes. It is in fact
the only javascript that is _added_ by designmodo. The rest is just bundled redistributable stuff.

# But why this seperate repository?
If you have ever tried to get Flat-UI running as a UI kit of choice for a modern single page app using buildtools such
as Webpack, you probably found out that this process is cumbersome. Luckily, all the redistributable stuff that
Flat-UI uses is installable per `npm`, which allows for these libraries to be loaded using `require()` statements.

lets take a look at some of the devDependencies of Flat-UI:

```json
devDependencies": {
    "jquery": "~1.11.1",
    "jquery-ui": "~1.10.4",
    "bootstrap": "~3.2.0",
    "bootstrap-switch": "~3.0.2",
    "holderjs": "~2.4.0",
    "typeahead.js": "~0.10.5",
    "bootstrap-tagsinput": "~0.4.2",
    "select2": "~3.5.1"
```

Not only are these sometimes dated, but radiocheck is missing as it was _bundled_ with Flat-UI. So if you want to walk down the path of modern build tools with Flat-UI, you can get a lot, but not everything. Until now.

# How to use this?

`npm install flatui-radiocheck --save`

Will download and install the node_module and add it to your package.json.

You can then simply `require('flatui-radiocheck')` in your code. After that you can simply do a `$('input[type=checkbox]').radiocheck()` and all should be well.

Mind you that you will obviously need all the other dependencies and ofcourse the CSS, but there are a lot of options here. You can choose to have all the LESS/SASS stuff (if you want to maintain flexibility, but if you'd want that than why choose Flat-UI to begin with, right?), you can opt to use a `require()`able version of just the CSS (check npmjs.com), or you can simply just use a redistributable, minified css and host it as a static file.
